# Geometry Rays
 Recreation of [Geometry Dash](https://store.steampowered.com/app/322170/Geometry_Dash) made in rust bindings of raylib.

# Compiling
 So to compile it run cargo build --release

 Then move the binary to the root folder.

 Thats it! Well you have to run it of course but like thats obvious.

 If you want to build an entire release with builds for multiple platforms run the build-release.sh file!

 If you get issues then let us know in the discord!
