# Geometry Rays
 Recreation of [Geometry Dash](https://store.steampowered.com/app/322170/Geometry_Dash) made in rust bindings of raylib.

 As of writing this readme this game is in a VERY early state and doesnt even have proper levels yet. I invision a full game with online levels in the future but thats very far away.

# Compiling
 As of writing this no pre-made executables have been made since theres no real point right now.

 So to compile it run cargo build --release

 Then move the binary to the root folder.

 Thats it! Well you have to run it of course but like thats obvious.

 If you want to build an entire release with builds for multiple platforms run the build-release.sh file!

 If you get issues then let us know in the discord!
